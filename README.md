Weather App using Java and JavaFX programming langues. A desktop client with a clean, user-friendly interface for looking up city weather and viewing current conditions (and basic forecasts). Built as a CS342 group project with Muhammad Kamil. I co-designed the UI and implemented core event handling, data retrieval, and error messaging to make it easy to use.

SCENE 1:
The job of this scene is to introduce the user to the app, where it contains the logo, the name of the app, Weather Forecast, and gives the user two options: the user can press the button of daily weather, where it will take the user to a new scene that shows the current weather and short wind description of the current day, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow while the other option is location based; that will take the user to a scene where the user is able to enter coordinates of a location that gives him weather information of that location. The scene will also have the option to exit the app.
SCENE 2:
This scene will give the current date, the temperature, and a short description of wind. All of which are text fields. The scene will also give the day and night temperatures of the current date, the date after and the date after; all of which are text fields. The scene will have the option button to return to the scene 1 and have the option button to exit the app.
SCENE 3:
This scene will enable the user to insert coordinates of a location in two text fields, one for x and one for y, and right to those text fields is a button named search, so when the user hits that button after giving the location coordinates, the weather information of that location will be shown in terms of temperature and short description of wind. Both the temperature and wind description are text fields. The scene will have the option button to return to the scene 1 and have the option button to exit the app.
